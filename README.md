Bracer of Time Project Files
============================

The Bracer of Time project is for the *LED Project Handbook*. It's a simple
e-textiles project which allows a roleplayer to set and monitor timers for
effects during a live-action roleplay scenario.

For more information about how to set up the Arduino IDE to use the Simblee
module, please check out the tutorial at https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/simblee-concepts/setting-up-arduino.
